{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"01 - Generating my security blog using GPT-4","contentHtml":"<p>What started as a \"I wonder if GPT-4 can do this?\" moment, resulted in my current security blog built from the ground up using markdown files and GPT-4's creative prowess.</p>\n<h2>GPT-4: AI's Master Wordsmith</h2>\n<p>GPT-4, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4, is the latest iteration of OpenAI's groundbreaking language model. It has made significant waves in the world of artificial intelligence due to its unparalleled ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and creative text that closely mimics human writing.</p>\n<h2>Crafting a Security Blog with GPT-4</h2>\n<p>Curious about its capabilities, I set out to see how GPT-4 could generate a security blog. The main requirements were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The blog should be easily updatable using markdown files.</li>\n<li>The blog should be static HTML/CSS/JS only (for security reasons).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Armed with these requirements, I turned to GPT-4 and asked the following question:</p>\n<p><code>I want to use nextjs to create a blog which will be generated from markdown files. The blog should use tailwindcss for its CSS and it will use nextjs to be exported statically and hosted using another web server. Can you create a nextjs blog template that will parse markdown files? The main page should have links to individual blog posts and it should also have a nice looking header and footer. I prefer the blog to be dark themed.</code></p>\n<p>GPT-4 responded with a functional, yet minimalistic template that would parse markdown files and export a static security blog using Next.js' export functionality.</p>\n<p>After about 25 questions and some tweaks and additions, the result is the blog you're currently browsing â€” a fully functional, dark-themed security blog entirely generated using the template GPT-4 provided. As a fascinating twist, GPT-4 not only generated the content of this post, but it also provided the text used in collaboration with DALL-E to create the blog's logo and banner.</p>\n","title":"Introducing My GPT-4 Generated Security Blog","date":"2023-31-03","subtitle":"Discover how GPT-4 built a functional, secure, and sleek blog from scratch.","image":"/images/blog1_image.png","banner":"/images/blog1_banner.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
