{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"blog1","contentHtml":"<p>\"Cloud computing\" plays a vital role in the creation of software products and services. It's also one of the most highly sought-after skills in the tech industry.</p>\n<p>In fact, most of the projects on this site will require cloud interaction of some sort—particularly with AWS's serverless products.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To use AWS in these projects, we'll need to set up an account, the CLI, and the SDK.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Create an account</h3>\n<p>If you don't already have an account then <a href=\"https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start\">sign up here</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you are signed up, you should be able to log in to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\">AWS Console</a>. It might look overwhelming if you're seeing for the first time.</p>\n<h3>Install the CLI</h3>\n<p>The AWS CLI is a command-line application that lets you interact with your AWS account from the terminal. It's available on all platforms.</p>\n<p>If you are a proficient Python user, you can just install it with <code>pip</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>pip install awscli\n</code></pre>\n<p>Otherwise, check out the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html\">official instructions</a>.</p>\n<p>Once installed, you should be able to run this command from the terminal to see its version.</p>\n<pre><code>aws --version\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Create an IAM user</h3>\n<p>The CLI will access your AWS account via an \"IAM user.\" You can create one from the <strong>Users</strong> page in your <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam\">IAM console</a>.</p>\n<p>Once the user is created, you'll need to generate access keys (passwords, essentially) for it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html\">Creating an Admin IAM User</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey\">Creating access keys for a user</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your access keys should look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Access key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\nSecret access key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Configure the CLI</h3>\n<p>Next you need to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html\">configure the CLI</a> so that it can access your AWS account via the IAM user.</p>\n<p>Basically, just run this command and paste in your access keys.</p>\n<pre><code>aws configure\n</code></pre>\n<p>Additionally, you'll also be asked for a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-region\">default region</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-format\">default output format</a>.</p>\n<p>You may leave them empty—but generally I like to use:</p>\n<pre><code>Default region name [None]: us-east-1\nDefault output format [None]: json\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Configuration files</h3>\n<p>Once configured, the AWS CLI <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html\">saves the credentials</a> and region/format profiles to your computer. They are typically in these locations:</p>\n<pre><code>~/.aws/credentials\n~/.aws/config\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can open them up and edit them if you like or just run <code>aws configure</code> again to change them.</p>\n<h3>Test the CLI!</h3>\n<p>Now you should be able to use your CLI to access AWS. For example, I should be able to see the S3 buckets I have in <code>us-east-1</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>aws s3 ls\n\n2020-12-09 22:36:32 blog.pixegami.com\n2020-12-27 00:04:52 cloud-archiver.5dac84a54677.archivetest\n</code></pre>\n<p>Generally, everything that can be done in the console can also be done in the CLI. Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/index.html\">full reference guide here</a>.</p>\n<h3>AWS SDK</h3>\n<p>Finally, to use AWS directly from your application code, you need to download the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">SDK</a> for the language you work with.</p>\n<p>The SDKs can be configured in different ways as well, but by default it usually uses the same profiles and credentials stored by your <code>aws configure</code>.</p>\n<h3>That's it!</h3>\n<p>You're all set to start using AWS.</p>\n<h2>Why AWS?</h2>\n<p>When we bring \"the cloud\" into a project, it's usually because there's some capability we'd like to add.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hosting for a website or service.</li>\n<li>File or data storage.</li>\n<li>On-demand computation.</li>\n<li>Authentication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And there's many viable solutions to choose from—<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/\">Azure</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com\">Google Cloud</a>, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com\">Firebase</a>, <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com\">Digital Ocean</a>.</p>\n<p>So why could you choose <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/\">AWS</a> over any of these alternatives? From a new user's perspective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Largest marketshare (at 30%)</strong> which roughly translates to lots of community resources and job opportunities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Most services available (175+)</strong> which means more tools at your disposal, well-integrated under one umbrella.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the flip-side, the biggest drawback is its upfront complexity.</p>\n<p>Personally though, the reason I use AWS is because it's the technology I'm most familiar with.</p>\n<h2>Why Serverless?</h2>\n<p><strong>It's cheaper.</strong> Most cloud \"getting started\" guides will show you how to spin up a server—a mercenary rented computer that stays online  24/7 to do your bidding.</p>\n<p>But for most of my projects, I'm going utilize technology that doesn't require a hosted server. In particular:</p>\n<p>| Service | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| S3 | File storage |\n| DynamoDB | Database |\n| Lambda | Compute engine |</p>\n<p>Their on-demand pricing means the cost scales with usage. There is a <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&#x26;all-free-tier.sort-order=asc\">free tier</a>, and it only begins to cost money if usage exceeds a certain amount.</p>\n<p>For small projects with light traffic, this usually translates to monthly costs of <strong>less than a dollar</strong> (if not completely free).</p>\n<p>In comparison, the price of hosting a server typically starts at <strong>$5.00 per month</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Continue Learning</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/\">Official documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubCNZRNjhyo\">Free YouTube videos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate/\">Udemy Courses</a></li>\n</ul>\n","title":"CVE‑2022‑4009 - Breaking CSS using a very long title in my blog preview","subtitle":"This is just a test blog","image":"/images/blog1_logo.png","banner":"/images/blog1_banner.png","date":"2020-12-29"}},"__N_SSG":true}
